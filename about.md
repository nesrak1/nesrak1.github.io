I'm nes. I'm majoring in Computer Science, but I also have an intrest in Cybersecurity. My hobby is modding and creating games (although I haven't made any desktop games good enough to publish yet.)

I'm part of the [IrisSec](https://irissec.xyz) group, where we participate in different online [cybersecurity CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).

I also do various things in the modding community.

For more info, see [my projects list](/2023/09/19/projects.html).
