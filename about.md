I'm nes. I'm majoring in Computer Science, but I also have an intrest in Cybersecurity. My hobby is modding and creating games (although I haven't made any desktop games good enough to publish yet.)

I'm part of the [IrisSec](https://irissec.xyz) group, where we participate in different online [cybersecurity CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).

As for modding, I'm currently helping out in the Unity modding tool community with [AssetRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper) for shader bytecode decompilation as well as developing [some](https://github.com/nesrak1/AssetsTools.NET) [of](https://github.com/nesrak1/HKWorldEdit2) [my](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA) [own](https://github.com/nesrak1/FSMViewAvalonia) [tools](https://github.com/nesrak1/UCrashLogDet).

I'm also working on various tools like TermiNotes, a tool for diagraming and note taking in the terminal, and Tenrekt, a reverse engineering hex editor.
