## What is js13kgames?

js13kGames is a competition where a theme is provided and a JavaScript game has to be designed and developed in 30 days. The catch is the game has to be 13 kilobytes or below. Because of this, most engines cannot be used (like [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)). So either you have to use a js13k specific engine or develop your own. I chose the route of developing my own engines for these games.

The first js13k entry: 2d side scroller where you collect things... or something. Only started on the last week so I didn't get much progress done.

The second js13k entry: first 3d game I made and first time using WebGL. Has a lot of different mechanics like flying the space ship around space, landing on planets to collect more... things, and a boss after each planet. Probably one of the most polished games I put out.

The third js13k entry: second 3d game using the same 3d engine as before. Was completely unfinished (only two out of five levels were done) but the engine got some extra features.

The first unreleased js13k game: dddddg. Added lighting/shadows/bloom to the engine but hardly any gameplay was finished. (School was pretty busy)

The second unreleased game: Escape Space. Same issue as last year, although the engine got some upgrades as usual.

The fourth js13k entry: Capturing Souls on the River of The Dead. Row your boat and collect souls to upgrade the boat at the shop. Featured infinite terrain generation, custom shaders in the engine, and (what I thought was) an interesting method of input: you row with the mouse instead of the arrow keys. Also, you need to avoid obstacles or lose some of your energy.
